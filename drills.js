// Big O Drills! 


/**
 * #1
 * 
 * Determine the Big O for the following algorithm: You are sitting in a room with 15 people. You want to 
 * find a playmate for your dog, preferably of the same breed. So you want to know if anyone out of the 15 
 * people have the same breed as your dog. You stand up and yell out, who here has a golden retriever and would 
 * like to be a playdate for my golden. Someone yells - "I do, be happy to bring him over"
